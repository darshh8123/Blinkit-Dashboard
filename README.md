# Blinkit Sales Dashboard
## Project Overview

This project is a Power BI dashboard built to analyze sales data from Blinkit, a fast delivery app.
The goal was to quickly understand key sales metrics, trends, and product performance through interactive visualizations.

## Dashboard Features

The dashboard provides a clear summary with the following visuals:

Key Metrics → Total sales ($1.2M), total transactions (9K), average rating (3.92), and average sales value ($141).

Sales Breakdown → A donut chart showing sales distribution by item fat content (Low Fat, Regular, etc.).

Sales Over Time → A line chart tracking how sales have changed by outlet establishment year.

Outlet Insights → Sales performance comparison across Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 outlets.

Detailed Drilldown → A table with sales data for different item types and outlet sizes with average sales values.

Geographical View → Map visualization showing sales distribution by outlet location type.

## How It Was Made

Tool → Power BI

Data → Imported dataset prepared directly in Power BI

Analysis → Simple DAX calculations used for total sales, average rating, and average sales value

Visualization → Interactive charts and filters (slicers) for Item Type, Outlet Location, and Outlet Size

## Key Insights

Highest Sales come from Low Fat product categories (~61% of total sales).

Tier 3 outlets contribute the most to overall sales, followed by Tier 2 and Tier 1.

Sales have shown steady growth after outlet establishments, with peak sales reaching ~$0.20M in recent years.
